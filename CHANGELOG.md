# Changelog

All notable changes to `makerskills` are documented here. Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

**Versioning note**: the plugin tag (e.g. `v0.5.0`) reflects the meta-collection version. Each skill has its own `metadata.version` in its SKILL.md frontmatter that evolves independently — a plugin release may contain skills at different internal versions.

---

## [v1.4.1] — 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- **Hosted Agent transport safety** — updated network-dependent research, media, knowledge, planning, and scaffolding skills to use reviewed typed actions when available and otherwise stop with an explicit unavailable state. Removed instructions that depended on local network CLIs, package installation, direct provider requests, or remote media downloads inside a sandboxed tool subprocess.

---

## [v1.4.0] — 2026-07-15

### Added
- **`decide` Q39 — opportunity cost** (skill v0.3.0, closes #11) — a reader on X pointed out the 37signals 38 never directly ask "if we say yes to this, what are we saying no to?" (nearest: Q36 return-on-effort, Q37 easier/harder). Added as a clearly-labeled **house addition** so the original 38 stay faithful to the source, and wired into triage: money decisions and big time/focus commitments now pull Q39.

---

## [v1.3.0] — 2026-07-14

### Added
- **New skill: `unstuck`** (v0.1.0, closes #9) — the roadblock antidote. When a solution seems impossible, it refuses to take no for an answer: classifies what kind of "no" you hit (assumption / framing / gatekeeper / tool / resource / physics), triages 3–4 lateral-thinking techniques from a 10-technique inventory (`references/techniques.md` — assumption autopsy, inversion, first principles, altitude shift, work-backwards, analogical transfer, constraint toggling, provocation, SCAMPER, interrogate-the-no), and enforces a 10-angle minimum before evaluating anything. **Agent-proactive by design**: agents run the fast path on themselves before reporting any dead end, so "that's not supported" always arrives with tried-angles receipts. Honest-exit guardrail: "the wall is load-bearing, reroute the goal" is a legitimate output, and a no from consent/law/ethics is a real no. Archives to `$MAKERSKILLS_CONFIG/unstuck/archive/` — a growing pattern library of which techniques crack *your* walls. Sits upstream of `decide` (generates options when there appear to be none; `decide` picks among them). 18 → 19 skills.

---

## [v1.2.0] — 2026-07-10

### Fixed
- **Archives moved out of the install tree** (closes #5; `decide`, `business-brainstorm`, `deep-research`, `personal-cfo`, `slide-deck` all → v0.2.0) — skills previously archived user state inside their own skill folder (`references/*-archive/`). Installers that re-sync skills from source (e.g. `npx skills add`) wiped the folder on upgrade, destroying the user's whole archive. Archives now live in `${MAKERSKILLS_CONFIG:-$HOME/.config/makerskills}/<skill>/archive/` (matching the public/private split ARCHITECTURE.md already documented), with a best-effort migration step: each skill moves old in-repo archive entries to the new location if they still exist (plugin/symlink installs keep them; an npx re-sync that already ran may have deleted them — that loss is exactly the bug this fixes going forward). Repo no longer ships INDEX.md seeds; `.gitignore` guards against old-style in-repo archives.
- **Gender-neutral prose** — skill bodies referred to the user as "he/his/him" in 16 places across 9 files ("capture his answers," etc.). All rewritten to they/their/the user.
- **`slide-deck` no longer hardcodes the author's identity** — the close-slide footer (`@coreyhaines · corey.co`) is now `<AUTHOR_HANDLE> · <AUTHOR_SITE>` tokens sourced from `$MAKERSKILLS_CONFIG/slide-deck/identity.yaml` (or asked once and saved); decks never ship with someone else's handle. Stray corey.co mentions genericized.

*Thanks to a user bug report for all three.* 🙏

---

## [v1.1.0] — 2026-07-06

### Added
- **`company-brain` trust levels + review mode** (skill v0.2.0, closes #3) — answers "what stops dumped-in info from poisoning context?":
  - `trust:` field on every structured-raw capture: `unreviewed` (default) / `verified` / `deprecated` / `superseded`. Named `trust`, not `status`, to avoid colliding with the lifecycle `status:` fields on `companies/` and `decisions/`. Files with no `trust:` field are treated as `unreviewed`.
  - **Query trust rules** — prefer `verified` + recent; never use `deprecated`/`superseded` as context; surface conflicts; flag low-confidence answers built mostly on `unreviewed` sources.
  - **New `/cb review` mode** — human triage queue (unreviewed captures + lint flags + lapsed review dates) with verify / deprecate / supersede / skip dispositions. Respects sensitivity levels; every non-skip disposition stamps `reviewed` + `reviewed_by`; saves a review summary to `outputs/` for an audit trail. Pair with `loopify` for a weekly cadence.
  - **Compile trust filtering** — deprecated/superseded sources excluded from wiki pages; pages built mostly on unreviewed sources get a warning callout.
  - **Lint check 13** — review backlog (>20 unreviewed files or no review pass in >1 month).
  - Deprecation replaces deletion — the "never delete raw files" rule stays intact.

### Fixed
- `company-brain` lint said "same six checks as second-brain" but second-brain has seven; company-brain additions renumbered 8–13.
- Meeting filename pattern and a `person-`/`people/` reference aligned between SKILL.md and schema.md.

## [v1.0.0] — 2026-07-06

Public launch. 🚀

18 skills for founders and indie operators, organized in five groups: meta (`skillify` / `toolify` / `loopify`), decision + strategy (`decide` / `business-brainstorm` / `deep-research` / `domain`), knowledge (`second-brain` / `company-brain` / `read-book` / `watch-video`), output (`jab-hook` / `slide-deck`), and operations (`pm` / `personal-cfo` / `company-cfo` / `paste` / `social-fetch`).

### Changed
- Genericized remaining brand mentions in `BACKLOG.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `README.md` (follow-ups since v0.5.4).
- Version bumped to 1.0.0 — no breaking changes from v0.5.4; this marks launch stability.

---

## [v0.5.4] — 2026-07-01

### Fixed
Three follow-up issues surfaced by `codex review` on v0.5.3:

- **Missed brand mentions** — `skills/pm/references/boards.md` example row said `_example_magister_`, `skills/social-fetch/SKILL.md` + `references/output-schema.md` still cited `@coreyganim`, and `skills/watch-video/SKILL.md` + `skills/slide-deck/SKILL.md` still mentioned "Factory Floor." Genericized all four to placeholders.
- **`/pm setup` re-introduced personal data** — the setup mode instructed the agent to save new board mappings back to `references/boards.md` in the tracked repo, which would leak real business names + board IDs. Changed to write to `${MAKERSKILLS_CONFIG:-$HOME/.config/makerskills}/pm/boards.md`. Repo's `references/boards.md` is now clearly marked TEMPLATE only.
- **skillify cross-repo loop had two bugs** — (a) `yq` output includes a literal `~` in paths like `~/code/makerskills`, but the shell doesn't expand `~` inside a quoted variable, so `grep` looked under a directory called `~` and found nothing. Fixed by explicit `${raw/#\~/$HOME}` expansion. (b) The config path hardcoded `~/.config/makerskills`, ignoring users with `MAKERSKILLS_CONFIG` set to a different location. Both loops (`SKILL.md` + `references/update-propagation.md`) now honor the env var.

---

## [v0.5.3] — 2026-07-01

### Changed
- **Public-launch polish**: swept remaining personal brand names, partner names, and private-sibling references out of `EXAMPLES.md` and 8 skills (`business-brainstorm`, `pm`, `jab-hook`, `second-brain`, `company-brain`, `deep-research`, `personal-cfo`, `skillify`, `social-fetch`, `watch-video`) plus `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `README.md`. Placeholders (`<owner>`, `Property A`, `<person>`, etc.) replace anything user-specific.
- **`skillify`**: sibling repo list moved out of hardcoded prose into `${MAKERSKILLS_CONFIG:-$HOME/.config/makerskills}/skillify/repos.yaml`. `--cross-repo` propagation now iterates over the user's declared repos instead of a fixed list.
- **`business-brainstorm`**: portfolio-fit + distribution + opportunity-cost dimensions now load user-specific context from `${MAKERSKILLS_CONFIG:-$HOME/.config/makerskills}/business-brainstorm/portfolio.local.md` if present, instead of hardcoding one operator's businesses.
- **`pm`**: board config and team/partner overlay load from `${MAKERSKILLS_CONFIG:-$HOME/.config/makerskills}/pm/{boards.md, team.local.md}` — repo's `references/boards.md` is now just a template.

### Removed
- Dropped inline cross-references to `cf-skills` (a private companion plugin external users can't install) from `personal-cfo`, `jab-hook`, `company-brain`, `social-fetch`, `watch-video`, and `second-brain`. Fresh users no longer see "sibling for CF agency books" style references to something they can't get.
- Dropped `~/.claude/memory/feedback_cf_*.md` references from `jab-hook` — those are personal memory files, not portable.

---

## [v0.5.0] — 2026-07-01

### Added
- **`domain`** — 11-step `.com` domain-hunt workflow on Laura Roeder's "availability-first, never fall in love with a name" methodology. Multi-tool ensemble: Vercel CLI + `whois` (per-TLD server) + `rdap.org` (modern TLDs) + Domainr API + Namecheap API + `agent-browser` for USPTO trademark screening + click-through URLs for aftermarket marketplaces (HugeDomains / Afternic / Sedo / Dan). Handles bare-word + prefix/suffix brainstorming (`try/use/with/join/get/go/hey/the` + word, `word +ly/+ify/+labs`), budget filtering, negotiation guidance, social handle checks, and (on confirmation) purchase via Vercel or Namecheap. Ported from a personal slash command; generic for adopters.

### Changed
- `README.md` skill catalog now reflects 18 skills.
- `INSTALL.md` documents 4 new optional env vars: `DOMAINR_API_KEY`, `NAMECHEAP_API_USER`, `NAMECHEAP_API_KEY`, `NAMECHEAP_CLIENT_IP`.
- `makerskills-website` skills.ts updated to include `domain` (skill count 17 → 18).

---

## [v0.4.0] — 2026-07-01

### Added
- **`company-cfo`** — anonymized team-scope sibling to `personal-cfo`. Monthly snapshots + weekly cash pulse + scenario projector, applied to company books. Universal methodology preserved (transaction-sum EOM computation, categorization discipline, intramonth cycle-low tracking, cash floor discipline) — company-specific data stripped so any team can adopt.
  - Four modes: `monthly` (default, 7-phase workflow) / `weekly` (thin cash pulse) / `scenario` (ad-hoc projector modeling) / `pickup` (resume from prior run)
  - Data source pattern generalized across bank / payment processor / payroll / expense management. Wire via `/toolify`; schedule via `/loopify`.
  - First-run walkthrough seeds a per-company `CLAUDE.md` from `references/company-config-template.md`.
  - Ships with 3 references: `eom-cash-methodology.md` (the transaction-sum method + why walkback fails), `categorization.md` (lock categories for the fiscal year), `company-config-template.md` (seed for the per-company config).

### Changed
- New env var `COMPANY_CFO_ROOT` documented in `README.md` + `INSTALL.md`.
- `makerskills-website` skills.ts updated (16 → 17).
- Vocabulary file (`~/.config/youtubeskills/vocabulary.local.md`) extended with the "CFO family" — *"Personal CFO for your household. Company CFO for your business."*

---

## [v0.3.0] — 2026-06-30

### Added
- **`company-brain`** — team-scope sibling to `second-brain`. Structured raw dirs (`people/`, `companies/`, `meetings/`, `sops/`, `decisions/`, `customer-language/`, `recurring-questions/`, `sales-objections/`) instead of flat type-prefixed `raw/`. Multi-author attribution (`author:` stamp on every capture, cited in wiki `## Sources` sections). Sensitivity tagging (`internal` / `leadership` / `confidential`) respected in query mode. Optional auto-sync source recipes for Fathom / Gong / Granola / Slack / email / CRM (wired via `/toolify`, scheduled via `/loopify`).
  - Positioning line: *"Second Brain made YOU a knowledge worker. Company Brain makes your TEAM one."*
  - Operational backbone for the **Company Brain Setup** productized CF service (renamed from "Second Brain as a Service" for vocabulary consistency with the skill name).

### Changed
- New env var `COMPANY_BRAIN_VAULT` documented in `README.md` + `INSTALL.md`.
- `makerskills-website` skills.ts updated (15 → 16).

---

## [v0.2.0] — 2026-06-30

### Added
- **`skillify`** — consolidates the prior `create-skill`, `adapt-skill`, and `update-skill` into a single skill with mode routing. **CREATE** mode covers from-chat / from-video / from-dump / from-scratch input paths. **ADAPT** mode ports an external skill with three-bucket classification (keep verbatim / adapt / add), license check, and attribution file. **UPDATE** mode improves existing skills from learnings with cross-skill propagation, memory-vs-skill triage, and semver discipline. All original reference files preserved under `skills/skillify/references/` with mode prefixes.
- **`toolify`** — wizard for wiring up an integration, API, MCP server, or third-party service into a Next.js or Rails project. Handles auth, env vars, client wrapper, webhook signature verification, and smoke-test. Scoped tightly (Next.js + Rails) — supporting every stack would bloat the wizard.
- **`loopify`** — wizard for setting up an agent loop, cron-scheduled task, or recurring workflow. Judgment layer on top of `ScheduleWakeup` / `CronCreate` / built-in `/loop` — picks pattern (dynamic / cron / one-shot), tunes delay for cache windows (avoids the 5-minute cache-miss cliff), enforces idempotency, requires bail-out conditions.

### Removed
- `create-skill`, `adapt-skill`, `update-skill` — replaced by `skillify` (mode-routed).

### Changed
- `README.md` catalog reorganized: Meta section renamed to *"Meta — extend Claude Code (the -ify trifecta)"*. All cross-references in other SKILL.md files updated (e.g., `watch-video` now references `skillify from-video` instead of `create-skill from-video`).
- Vocabulary moat strategy: the trifecta names (`skillify` / `toolify` / `loopify`) added to `~/.config/youtubeskills/vocabulary.local.md` for consistent use in YT scripts + descriptions. See `~/Corey's Projects/wiki/Founding Marketing Frameworks.md` for the broader vocabulary strategy.

### Constraints (documented, self-imposed)
- **Rule of 3**: the `-ify` family stays at exactly three. Resist Hookify / Configify / Memorify temptations.
- **No backward-compatibility shims** on the rename. Clean cutover per repo's public flip date (2026-06-28) — audience small enough that no shim is needed.

---

## [v0.1.0] — 2026-06-28

Initial public release. 15 skills across 5 families:

- **Meta — manage skills themselves**: `create-skill`, `adapt-skill`, `update-skill` (consolidated to `skillify` in v0.2.0)
- **Decision & strategy**: `decide` (37signals framework), `business-brainstorm` (9-dimension pressure-test), `deep-research` (multi-source with citations)
- **Knowledge & content consumption**: `second-brain` (Karpathy LLM Wiki over markdown vault), `read-book` (PDF/EPUB/MOBI notes), `watch-video` (transcript/visual/multimodal)
- **Output & creative**: `jab-hook` (Gary Vee's rotation on X + LinkedIn via Typefully), `slide-deck` (branded React decks with Playwright export)
- **Operations & utilities**: `pm` (Kanban + Eisenhower, tool-agnostic adapters), `personal-cfo` (household financial scenarios), `paste` (clean terminal output for 9 destinations), `social-fetch` (normalized fetcher across 10 social platforms)

Public flip on 2026-06-28 via `git filter-repo` history scrub — personal data (Typefully IDs, portfolio properties, voice overlays, archives) migrated to `~/.config/makerskills/` (gitignored, on-disk only). Repo pattern locked: **public + generic code + private personal-config layer**.

Documentation established: `README.md` skill catalog + architecture, `INSTALL.md` env vars + runtime dependencies, `LICENSE` (MIT), `BACKLOG.md` skill shortlist + brainstorm candidates.
